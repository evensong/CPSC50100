Homework files


I'm just a noob starting a github account to share homework code. Anyone is free to look or copy code (real hackers probably won't find anything interesting here), but I won't be allowing pull requests, since this repo is supposed to be my own work. Please feel free to leave comments, though, I'm always looking to improve!

In particular, if anyone with experience using git or GitHub can tell that I'm doing something in a really awkward way, please let me know the better way! I have literally never used git before today.

Note: I started in C++, so I'm just learning Java syntax
